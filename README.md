## C Reliable File Transfer protocol that works on top of UDP 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate two file transfer protocols: 
• Reliable file transfer (RFT) with positive acknowledgement in the absence of errors 
(implemented in the function send_file_normal) 
• Reliable file transfer (RFT) with positive acknowledgement and retransmission  – an example 
of a PAR protocol (implemented in the function send_file_with_timeout)
